# react-simple-modal-oc-p14

Here is the first NPM package I built and it was for my OpenClassroom's course.

I developped a simple modal to display some customizable text and a close button.

It requires React Hooks useState to works and some defined props.

Here is an exemple, with the code you'll need to add into your component.

## Configuration

- set your text with `const setText = string`
- set `const setText = string`
